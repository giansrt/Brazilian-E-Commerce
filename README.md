## Business Understanding

### Context
This project aims to leverage customer transaction data from a Brazilian ecommerce platform to understand customer purchasing behavior and identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns. By employing a Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) analysis, we seek to segment customers based on their purchase patterns and develop tailored marketing strategies to increase customer retention, boost average order value, and drive overall revenue growth. 

### Problem Statement
How can we effectively segment customers based on their purchase behavior to optimize marketing efforts, enhance customer loyalty, and drive sustainable business growth?
Cluster Segments: High-Value Customers, Frequent Buyers, Occasional Shoppers, Bargain Hunters
- High-Value Customers: Customers who spend significantly more than the average.
- Frequent Buyers: Customers who make purchases frequently but with moderate spend.
- Occasional Shoppers: Customers who purchase infrequently.
- Bargain Hunters: Customers who are price-sensitive and respond well to discounts.
